## 📖 What is json-inference?

json-inference is a tool that helps you get neat and structured data from various large language models (LLMs). It does this by using one simple command. This means you don’t need to write complicated code or deal with confusing errors. 

It works with 12 different LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini. The tool makes sure the data it gives you matches a specific format you expect. If something goes wrong, it tries again, so you get the right output without hassle.

This tool is perfect for anyone who wants to use advanced language AI without getting stuck on technical details.
